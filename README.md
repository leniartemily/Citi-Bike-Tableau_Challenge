## General info
Using the New York City Citi Bike data, I cleaned the csv files to create 3 data sets. All 3 data sets were from March 2019-2021. I chose this month and these years in hopes of finding a change in the data from the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Predictions
Before I scraped the data sets, I predicted that the amount of Citi Bike use would be significantly different while comparing the years 2019, 2020 and 2021.

## Technologies
* GitBash
* Jupyter Notebook
* Tableau
* Kaggle Dataset

## Results
Based on the comparisons between each year, there was not a significant decline and or incline between the 3 years. This may be because bike users did not want to take public transportation and knew that they were able to clean/disinfect the bike of any germs. I was surprised with this dataset and think that because there are over one million Citi Bikes in the New York City area, the data may have been skewed.
