## General info
Using the New York City Citi Bike data, I cleaned the csv files to create 3 data sets. All 3 data sets were from March 2019-2021. I chose this month and these years in hopes of finding a change in the data from the COVID-19 pandemic. I used the Maps to display the number of Citi Bikes in New York City, the age of riders to find which age was riding the bikes the most during these times and the Trendline shows the most popular day in March to ride. Due to the Data being so large, I was unable to configure the 2021 information without it being a straight line that showed no change. Overall, there wasn't as dramatic of a change that I was hoping to see. 

## Predictions
Before I scraped the data sets, I predicted that the amount of Citi Bike use would be significantly different while comparing the years 2019, 2020 and 2021.

## Technologies

* Link shows: 2019 Citi Bike locations, 2020 Citi Bike Location and the 2021 Citi Bike locations. This was to measure the density of Citi Bikes throughout the 3 years
* 2020 vs 2019 Rider's Birth year compares the ages of the riders in 2020 and 2019
* 2020 vs 2019 Trend line Compares which day in March had the most riders



## Results
Based on the comparisons between each year, there was not a significant decline and or incline between the 3 years. This may be because bike users did not want to take public transportation and knew that they were able to clean/disinfect the bike of any germs. I was surprised with this dataset and think that because there are over one million Citi Bikes in the New York City area, the data may have been skewed.
